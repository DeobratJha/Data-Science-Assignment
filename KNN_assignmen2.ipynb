        "\n",
        "Computational complexity: KNN has a high computational cost during both training and prediction phases. As the size of the training set grows, the time required to compute distances between query points and all training samples increases significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Employing efficient data structures, such as KD-trees or ball trees, can accelerate the search for nearest neighbors and improve computational efficiency. Additionally, dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be used to reduce the feature space and alleviate computational complexity.\n",
        "Memory requirements: KNN requires storing the entire training set in memory for prediction. This can become impractical when dealing with large datasets or limited memory resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, like locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), can be employed to reduce memory requirements by trading off some accuracy. These algorithms provide efficient and memory-friendly approaches to finding approximate nearest neighbors.\n",
        "Sensitivity to feature scales: KNN relies on distance calculations, and features with different scales can disproportionately influence the distance metric. Features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Feature scaling techniques, such as min-max scaling (normalization) or standardization (Z-score normalization), can be applied to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation. Scaling the features to a similar range prevents the dominance of any particular feature due to its scale.\n",
        "Imbalanced data: KNN treats all neighbors equally when making predictions, regardless of class frequencies. In datasets with imbalanced class distributions, the majority class may dominate the prediction, leading to biased results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Applying class weighting or using distance-weighted voting can address the issue of imbalanced data. Weighting the contributions of neighbors based on their distance or class frequencies can give more importance to minority class samples and improve the model's performance on imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "Optimal K selection: The choice of the number of neighbors (K) is critical in KNN. A small K value may lead to overfitting and sensitivity to noise, while a large K value may result in oversmoothing and ignoring local patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: Techniques like cross-validation, grid search, or the elbow method can be employed to find the optimal K value. By evaluating the model's performance with different K values, the one that provides the best trade-off between bias and variance can be selected.\n",
        "Outliers: KNN is sensitive to outliers since their presence can significantly affect the distance calculations and influence the predictions.\n",
